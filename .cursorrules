# The Separation Game - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
This is "The Separation Game" - a soccer player connection finder (like Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon but for soccer).
Find the shortest path between two players through shared club teammates.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- sql.js for SQLite (pure JS, no native deps)
- React for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Design System
- Main background color: #f6f9fc
- Accent color: #635bff
- Accent light: #7c75ff
- Accent dark: #4b44c4
- Text primary: #1a1a2e
- Text secondary: #6b7280
- Clean, modern aesthetic
- Responsive design (mobile-first)

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use TypeScript interfaces over types where possible
- Keep components small and focused (<100 lines ideal)
- Co-locate component styles with components

## File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (PlayerCard.tsx)
- Utilities: camelCase (formatDate.ts)
- Types: PascalCase (Player.ts)
- API routes: route.ts in folder structure

## Data Rules
- Only club football counts (not national teams)
- Players must have actual appearances (not just roster)
- Use bidirectional BFS for pathfinding
- Cache path results for performance

## API Design
- RESTful endpoints under /api
- Return JSON with consistent structure
- Include proper error responses
- Use query params for GET requests

## Performance
- Graph loaded in memory at startup
- Debounce search inputs (300ms)
- Cache recent path queries
- Optimize images with next/image
